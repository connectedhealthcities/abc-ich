========================================

Version: 1.0

This is a list of features for the ABC-ICH Mobile application.
The features follow the Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) model and are written in a semi-formal format.

========
<Story> [ A clear and explicit title]								**REQUIRED**
	<Scenario> #1: [The name of the scenario] 						**REQUIRED**
		Given: [the initial context for the scenario]				**REQUIRED - 1 ONLY**
		And: [optional additional context information]				**ZERO OR MORE**
		When: [an event occurs that will trigger this scenario]		**REQUIRED - 1 ONLY**
		Then: [ the outcome that should happen]						**REQUIRED - 1 ONLY**
		And: [ optional additional outcome that should happen]		**ZERO OR MORE**
	</Scenario>    
</Story>

<Note> #1 Data validation popup
	A data validatuon popup is displayed whenever the user leaves any view (except "Patient Start", "Patient End" and "BP Management" views) by selecting the Next button.
	It summarises the data entered in that view and offers 2 possible actions:
	1. Ok - confirms that data entered is correct and allows navigation to proceed
	2. Cancel - Prevents navigation away from the view allowing the user to change the data entered.
</Note>
<Note> #2 
	It is assumed in all the navigation stories listed below that Ok is selected for the Data validation Popup and
	that the view navigation does not happen until all popups have been dismissed.
</Note>
<Note> #3 High water mark view (applies to tabs A and C)
	Users are not allowed to navigate backwards within the views belonging to a particular tab.
	Thus we use the term "high water mark view" to represent how far they have progressed through the views for a particular tab

<Story> View behaviour and layout
	<Note> #11
		Most views are self-describing with the dynamic show/hide behaviour being intuitively obvious.
		Only views where this is not the case are described here.
	</Note>
	<Scenario> #1: Calculate Beriplex view - display of "Reversal agent administered at external hospital?" card
		Given: the user has selected an external hospital on the "Register Patient" view
		When: the "Calculate Beriplex" view is displayed
		Then: the "Reversal agent administered at external hospital?" card is displayed
	</Scenario>   
	<Scenario> #2: Calculate Beriplex view - display of "Anti-coagulant is unknown and INR > 1.2. Prescribe Beriplex anyway?" card
		Given: the user has selected "Unknown" for anticogulant type on the "Anticoagulant Identification" view
		When: the user enters an INR value greater than 1.2
		Then: the "Anti-coagulant is unknown and INR > 1.2. Prescribe Beriplex anyway?" card is displayed
	</Scenario>     
	<Scenario> #3: Reversal Agent Details view - display of "Time reversal agent was administered is known?" card
		Given: the user has selected "Yes" for "Reversal agent administered at external hospital?" on the "Calculate Beriplex" view
		When: the "Reversal Agent Details" view is displayed
		Then: the "Time reversal agent was administered is known?" card is displayed
	</Scenario>     
	<Scenario> #4: Reversal Agent Details view - Reversal agent administered card - hide option "None"
		Given: the user has selected "Yes" for "Reversal agent administered at external hospital?" on the "Calculate Beriplex" view
		When: the "Reversal Agent Details" view is displayed
		Then: the "None" option on the "Reversal agent administered" card is hidden

<Story> Calculation of Beriplex dose
	<Note> #12 Calculation details
		The dose is calculated using the weight in Kg and the INR value.
		For the purposes of the calculatuion the weight is rounded to the nearest 10 Kg.
		If the weight is above 100Kg then it is fixed at 100Kg.
		If the weight is below 30Kg then it is fixed at 30Kg.
		The calculated value depends on which range the INR value falls within as follows:
		(1.3 - 3.9): dose = weightInKg x 25
		(4.0 - 6.0): dose = weightInKg x 35
		    (> 6.0): dose = weightInKg x 50
	</Note>
	<Scenario> #1: Calculation of Beriplex dose with Inr value
		Given: the user has entered valid data on the "Calculate Beriplex" view
		And: the user has selected "No" to the question "Do you plan to administer Beriplex without waiting for INR?"
		When: they select the "Next" button
		Then: the dose is calculated using the INR value entered
	</Scenario>     
	<Scenario> #2 Calculation of Beriplex dose without Inr value
		Given: the user has entered valid data on the "Calculate Beriplex" view
		And: the user has selected "Yes" to the question "Do you plan to administer Beriplex without waiting for INR?"
		When: they select the "Next" button
		Then: the dose is calculated using a default INR value within the range 1.3 - 3.9 
	</Scenario>

<Story> Data entry range validation
	<Note> #13
		The following data entry fields have ranges which the inputs should adhear to.

		A validation message is displayed when the input contains a value outside the allowed range.

		For a given view, if any validated input contains a value outside the allowed range then the next
		button is disabled.

		The validated fields are:

		Register Patient view - Initials
			2 or 3 characters.

		Register Patient view - Date of birth
			The date of birth field has two layers of verification:
			1) is it a valid date (e.g correct number of days entered for a given month)
			2) is the year within the allowed range: between 1900 and 14 years ago (inclusive)
			The range is not checked until the date is valid.
		
		Calculate Beriplex Dose view - INR value
			between 0.5 and 10 (inclusive)
		
		Calculate Beriplex Dose view - Weight
			between 10 and 300 Kg (inclusive)
			When the weight is entered in stone the validation is carried out against the automatically converted weight
			in Kg value.

		Bp Management view - SBP
			between 10 and 300 (inclusive)
		
		Bp Management - GTN rate
			Not required but if provided value must be between 0 and 20 (inclusive)
	 	
	 	Bp management - Labetalol dose
			Not required but if provided value must be between 0 and 100 (inclusive)
		
		Bp management - Pulse
			Not required but if provided value must be between 0 and 300 (inclusive)
		
		Neurosurgery Referral Criteria view - ICH volume
			This value is not visible until all fields are completed in the "ICH volume calculation" card.
			between 0 and 500 (inclusive)
