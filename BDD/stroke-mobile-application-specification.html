Stroke Mobile Application Specification
=======================================

This is a list of features for the Stroke Mobile application.
The features follow the Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) model and are written in a semi-formal format.

Template
========
<Story> [ A clear and explicit title]								**REQUIRED**
	<Scenario> #1: [The name of the scenario] 						**REQUIRED**
		Given: [the initial context for the scenario]				**REQUIRED - 1 ONLY**
		And: [optional additional context information]				**ZERO OR MORE**
		When: [an event occurs that will trigger this scenario]		**REQUIRED - 1 ONLY**
		Then: [ the outcome that should happen]						**REQUIRED - 1 ONLY**
		And: [ optional additional outcome that should happen]		**ZERO OR MORE**
	</Scenario>    
</Story>

<Note> #1 Data validation popup
	A data validatuon popup is displayed whenever the user leaves any view (except "Patient Start", "Patient End" and "BP Management" views) by selecting the Next button.
	It summarises the data entered in that view and offers 2 possible actions:
	1. Ok - confirms that data entered is correct and allows navigation to proceed
	2. Cancel - Prevents navigation away from the view allowing the user to change the data entered.
</Note>
<Note> #2 
	It is assumed in all the navigation stories listed below that Ok is selected for the Data validation Popup and
	that the view navigation does not happen until all popups have been dismissed.
</Note>
<Note> #3 High water mark view (applies to tabs A and C)
	Users are not allowed to navigate backwards within the views belonging to a particular tab.
	Thus we use the term "high water mark view" to represent how far they have progressed through the views for a particular tab

<Story> Calculation of Beriplex dose
	<Note> #10 Calculation details
		The dose is calculated using the weight in Kg and the INR value.
		For the purposes of the calculatuion the weight is rounded to the nearest 10 Kg.
		If the weight is above 100Kg then it is fixed at 100Kg.
		If the weight is below 30Kg then it is fixed at 30Kg.
		The calculated value depends on which range the INR value falls within as follows:
		(1.3 - 3.9): dose = weightInKg x 25
		(4.0 - 6.0): dose = weightInKg x 35
		    (> 6.0): dose = weightInKg x 50
	</Note>
	<Scenario> #1: Calculation of Beriplex dose with Inr value
		Given: the user has entered valid data on the "Calculate Beriplex" view
		And: the user has selected "No" to the question "Do you plan to administer Beriplex without waiting for INR?"
		When: they select the "Next" button
